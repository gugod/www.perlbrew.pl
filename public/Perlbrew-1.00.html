  <h2>Perlbrew 1.00</h2>
  <p>perlbrew 1.00 was released on 2024/10/4, a day when I (<a href="https://gugod.org">@gugod</a>) was
in a personal trip to the city of Hakodate, right before the awesome
conference of <a href="https://yapcjapan.org/2024hakodate/">YAPC::Hakodate, 2024</a>, in which I gave a short
presentation titled &quot;perlbrew 3000!&quot; -- it's a brief history of
perlbrew, when we look back from year 3000.
</p><p>While I'm generally just inchworming my way forward on various hobby
projects, it is also sometimes needed to temporarily become a
futurist, leaping forward in time in great steps, then look
backward. It's indeed easier that way, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLBTBBil2U">Jensen Huang has described
how himself not envisioning the future</a>,
since, well, it's all in the history book now.
</p><p>Very often, the version number 1.0 means something special, but to put
in to the history of perlbrew, it is merely a version that comes after
0.99, and the 91st relesae since version 0.10 -- the very the
beginning of perlbrew. Thanks to the internet and the participant of
OSDC.tw -- we could still look backward in time, and found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTQp5_iS6Zg">the very
first public announcement of perlbrew 0.10 on youtube.</a>.
</p><p>With or without any specialtiy in the social status of version
numbers, whole-number versions does sits in the position of being
milestones, and generally means something major, with enough maturity,
or something that might be breaking with past versions. That would be
enough reasons for me to aggregate my thoughts together and making up
a much longer release notes for perlbrew 1.00.
</p><p>Oh yes, it's <code>1.00</code>, not <code>1.0</code>. Not just because two 0s are better
one, but because conventionally I've been using 2 digits in the 2nd
part of version numbers, and I intend to keep it as a convention of
the perlbrew project. So the next major milestone would be <code>2.00</code>, but
not <code>2.0</code>.
</p><p>Someone might argue about why having such subtle differences since,
<code>1.00</code> vs <code>1.0</code>, they don't meaning different things: it's the same
point in the multi-dimensional plane of version numbers and they are
both parsed as the same version object by most of
version-number-parsing libraries (I hope.)
</p><p>Suffice to say, that it's the job the author, to give arbitrary
meanings to the version numbers of their software, and if you ask me,
I'd say it's non-sense to use even numbers to mean stability and odd
numbers to meaning instability. Prime numbers should be used to mean
something stable, since they are not breakable. I may eventually
engage with that rule.
</p><p>Anyhow, perlbrew 1.00 is out and we are now on the path to perlbrew
3000. I wholeheartly thank to the 148 contributors who've spent their
valuable time and provides commits for the perlbrew project.
</p><p>To get to perlbrew 3000, I extrapolate that, we will probably require
about 1000 more contributors. Developers, you know what to do.
</p><p>But for now, happy perlbrew-ing. üç∫
