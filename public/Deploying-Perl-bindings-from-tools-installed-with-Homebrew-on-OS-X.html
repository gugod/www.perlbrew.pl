  <h2>Deploying Perl bindings from tools installed with Homebrew on OS X</h2>
  <p>by  Lieven Hollevoet <a href="https://github.com/hollie">@hollie</a>
</p><p>I have been using Perlbrew happily on OS X to install custom/recent Perl versions. Sometimes I need a more or less exotic Perl binding that I could easily install using Homebrew. Recent updates to Homebrew made that process a bit less automatic.
</p><p>Below I describe how to install the perl-shared binding for RRDTool on a recent OS X with a recent version of Homebrew.
</p><h2>Why is it not working automatically
</h2><p>There are two issues with the combination of Perlbrew and Homebrew:
 <em> Homebrew assumes you're using the system Perl and does not automatically detect your locally-installed Perl.
 </em> Latest versions of Homebrew work in a sandbox environment. This means that the build chain has no write permissions to the folder that contains the Perlbrew site modules.
</p><h3>Detect locally-installed Perl version
</h3><p>This can be forced by passing to <code>brew</code> the option <code>--env=std</code>. For more information and the discussion about this please see the last posts in this <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/12090">support ticket</a>.
</p><h3>Work around the sandbox
</h3><p>When you're install a packet with brew, the sandbox seems to prohibit writes to other folders than the target folder for the brew process. This means that if a packet creates a Perl module, this module cannot be written to the Perl site module folder. To work around that: 
 <em> enable the option to not delete the build folder
 </em> navigate to the build folder yourself and install the perl module.
</p><h2>Practical example for RRDtool
</h2><p><code>brew install --env=std --build-from-source --keep-tmp rrdtool</code>
</p><p>Then navigate to the temp folder where the build results are retained. The full path is listed in the output of the previous command.
</p><p>Go into the subfolder <code>bindings/perl-shared</code> and do <code>make install</code> there. You'll see the RRDs.pm nicely be deployed into your favorite Perl version module folder.
