  <h2>The Discussion forum of perlbrew project</h2>
  <p>There has never being a online forum / discussion channel for general questions for perlbrew projects and therefoe such needs are dispatched to... everywhere.
</p><p>From time to time, people also use GitHub issue as the channel for Q and A... because it seems feasible. I also don't mind having general discussions via that interface becaues... well, I'm not really the everything-has-to-be-tidy-up kind of guy.
</p><p>That said.. a while ago I've discovered the &quot;Discussions&quot; feature is added to GitHub and enabled it for the repo &quot;gugod/App-perlbrew&quot;:
</p><p>Here: <a href="https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/discussions">https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/discussions</a>
</p><p>So... now there is only more place for general questions to go. Interface-wise it seems to be identila to GitHub issues. Since it is essentially free (it does not cost me extra mony to enable such feature) I'll just leave it on.
</p><p>Feel free to just drop by and share how perlbrew is useful  o you (or how it isn't -- that's cool too.)
